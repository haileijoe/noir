### Web Project Topic Approval

- **What is the purpose of the website?**

To share the unique opportunities available to visitors of Vermillion View Campground. In addition to contact information and directions to the grounds, it will provide useful information to know before arriving at the destination.

- **What do you want the website to accomplish?**

Garner a larger audience and potential customer base, inform them of key information and potentially avoid issues upon arrival and serve as a social sharing platform of photos and reviews made by previous customers.

- **Describe what needs to happen for you to consider your website a success:**

To create a functional and easy to navigate website. I would like a reservation to be easily created and cancelled without having to call a customer service number. I believe the customer base is retirees, and families who need less stress on travel and enjoy their vacation. I would like people to be able to blog on the site and share their travels and tips for visitors.

- **Who is your target audience?**

My target customers are retirees and just anyone who wants to camp on a cliffside, overlooking the vermillion cliffs. Also not having to spend more than $20 for a space.

- **What opportunity or issue is your website addressing?**

I must currently purchase the domain for the website, so that I own it outright. I also would need influencers to get the website to explode, as our economy is now influenced by people on social media.

- **What type of content might be included in your website?**

I would like there to be a meet the owners page, and the local area and ecology of the area. Possibly a history and geology lesson on the page is possible. I think in the future I could add Native Americans to do a story telling of some sort or dances. The possibilities are endless when adding on to it. There could even be a bed and breakfast type deal, when I have more income and capital.

- **List the URLs for at least two related or similar websites found on the Web:**

[Yogi Bearâ€™s Jellystone Park, Glen Ellis, NH](https://www.campjellystone.com)

[Pines Campgrounds, Yosemite National Park](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/pinescampgrounds.htm)

The NPS has a whole listing of them nationwide. It is easy to use, however it is a bit busy and there is a lot of information to take in. I feel that having less makes for a more comfortable viewing experience.
